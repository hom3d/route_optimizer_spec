# route_optimizer_spec
Spec for an Open-Source Tool for Routing Optimization in Logistics

# Overview

OpenRouteOptimizer is a Python-based open-source tool designed to address routing problems in logistics by optimizing routes for delivery vehicles. It is capable of handling multiple constraints, such as time windows, vehicle capacity, and delivery priorities, while providing users the flexibility to select different distance computation methods. The tool is designed to be accessible for small to medium-sized logistics companies and easily extensible for developers.

# Objectives

* Optimize Routes: Compute the most efficient routes for a set of delivery points.
* Flexible Distance Calculations: Offer multiple methods for distance computation to meet diverse logistics needs.
* Handle Constraints: Support real-world constraints, such as time windows and vehicle capacities.
* Visualization and Reporting: Provide interactive route visualizations and exportable reports.

# Key Features

* Core Functionalities:
    * Multi-vehicle route optimization.
    * Time windows and vehicle capacity constraints.
    * Custom cost functions based on user requirements.
* Distance Calculation Options:
    * Euclidean Distance: For quick approximations.
    * Great-Circle Distance (Haversine): For geographic coordinates.
    * Manhattan Distance: For grid-like road systems.
    * Road Network Distance: Using OpenStreetMap or Google Maps.
    * Travel Time: Accounting for real-time or historical traffic data.
    * Custom Cost Function: User-defined optimization metrics.
* Data Input/Output:
    * Accept input data in CSV, JSON, or Excel formats.
    * Export results in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats.
* Visualization:
    * Interactive route maps using Folium or Plotly.
    * Visual display of key metrics like distance, travel time, and cost.
* Reporting:
    * Generate downloadable reports summarizing optimized routes, costs, and metrics.

# Architecture

    * Parse input data (CSV, JSON, or Excel).
    * Validate data and handle missing entries.
* Routing Engine:
    * Compute distance matrix using the selected method.
    * Optimize routes using Google OR-Tools.
    * Handle constraints like time windows and capacities.

    * Display routes on an interactive map.
    * Include metrics like total distance, travel time, and cost.
* Output Module:
    * Export optimized routes in CSV/JSON.
    * Generate detailed reports in PDF/HTML.

# Workflow

* Data Upload:
    * User uploads delivery points and vehicle details.
* Data Validation:
    * Validate input data and resolve inconsistencies.
* Route Optimization:
    * Compute the distance matrix using the selected method.
    * Optimize routes considering constraints and cost functions.
* Visualization:
    * Display routes and performance metrics on an interactive map.
* Output Generation:
    * Provide results as downloadable files or reports.
